# finance-web-app

Background:

Project completed as part of the cs50 Introduction to Computer Science course to create a Flask web application for buying and selling shares. Each user starts with $10000. The password has been hashed, and the user is able to change their password. The user is recorded within Sessions. They can also see the list of their transactions.

Project period:

I started this project on the 16 September 2023 and completed the core of the project on the 21 September 2023, with the implementation history based on the user requirements individually tracked within To_Do.xls.xlsx, alongside the larger challenges associated with each task.
